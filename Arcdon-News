Illusio-Sapiens Deeper

After many tests and experimentations these creatures posses a unique set of skills unlike any other creature observed by scientists before.
These Abilities are as followed but not limited to:

Mimicking Human Voices of People to an accuracy of a recording

Mimicking appearance of any person who it consumes the DNA of (Hair, Skin, Organic Matter)

Mimicking appearance and sound of most domesticated animals (Cats, Dogs, Medium Sized Farm Animals) although it stays the same size kf it's self.

With these abilities it seems to have a strategy of luring its prey out by either scaring them into a vulnerable place or luring them out with the sounds of loved ones screaming or help.
If you think a loved one could be being mimicked there is steps you can take to be safe. 
Try these listed below:

Asking it questions they would know

If they only respond with a small selection of words (Help me, Let me in, I have something for you) not letting them in

Recognizing strange behaviors

Illusio-Sapiens are not Immortal! They have about the same dexterity of a stronger human, they are vulnerable to being hurt with most human weapons (for whatever reason they cannot he hurt with objects made of copper)
Almost any way you can hurt a person, you can hurt an Illusio-Sapien so stay armed and on the ready!

If you think you've come into contact with one of these creatures, contact the local authorities.
